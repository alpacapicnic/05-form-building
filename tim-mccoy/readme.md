**Author**: Tim McCoy
**Version**: 4.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
 This application is a blog that uses javascript to display content accordingly and implements a new html page that takes input nd coverts to a JSON string that can be copied into blogArticles and generated on the index.html page

## Getting Started
They'd access new.html directly and fill in the appropriate fields to generate their own article(s). Then they can pass that info into blogArticles.js to populate on the main page.

## Architecture
 HTML, CSS, jQuery, JSON, Ajax and Marked CDN links as well as CSS style pages and provided fonts/icons
